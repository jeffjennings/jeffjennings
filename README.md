### Hi! I'm Jeff<sup>*</sup>. 

<sup>*</sup>Or as I call myself, Batman.

I'm an Eberly Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Astronomy department at Pennsylvania State University.  
I work on super-resolution aperture synthesis techniques for radio interferometry 📡--📡 ;   
I try to make images of protoplanetary disks 📀 and debris disks 💍 look a bit sharper 🔪 👀.
