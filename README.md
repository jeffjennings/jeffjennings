### Hi! I'm Jeff.

I'm an Eberly Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at The Pennsylvania State University.  
I work on open-source software development to model and analyze datasets in (mostly sub-mm) astronomy, with a strong interest in open-source software development. My main scientific application is high resolution imaging of ALMA observations of protoplanetary and debris disks.
