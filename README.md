Hello! I'm a software engineer at the Flatiron Institute / Center for Computational Astrophysics. I develop and optimize software for research projects in astronomy, from core packages like Astropy to custom tools for hydrodynamical simulations, data modeling and analysis. I focus on machine learning frameworks and high performance computing. I was previously a postdoctoral researcher in astronomy studying the formation of planetary systems.
