### Hi! I'm Jeff.

I'm an Eberly Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at The Pennsylvania State University.  
I work on open-source software development to model and analyze datasets in astronomy, mostly for sub-mm interferometry (where data is native to the Fourier domain). My main scientific application of this software is high resolution imaging of ALMA observations of protoplanetary and debris disks to study the formation of planetary systems.

Apart from astronomy, I enjoy thinking of simple metrics to approach complex problems, applying machine learning algorithms to even more complex problems, and learning about 3D rendering.
