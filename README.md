### Hi! I'm Jeff.

I'm an Eberly Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at The Pennsylvania State University.  
I work on statistical algorithms to analyze and forward model datasets in radio astronomy, focusing on Fourier analysis, Bayesian statistics, Gaussian processes, and machine learning methods. My main application is super-resolution imaging of ALMA observations of protoplanetary and debris disks.
