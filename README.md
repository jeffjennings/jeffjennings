Hello! I'm a software engineer at the Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York. I develop and optimize software for research projects in astronomy ranging from hydrodynamical simulations to data modeling and analysis, with a focus on machine learning frameworks and high performance computing. I was previously a postdoctoral researcher in astronomy studying the formation of planetary systems.
